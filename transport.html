  <h2>Vehicle Routing Simulator</h2>
  <p>
    We decided to build this project because of the complexity of routing systems. In my 480 class, we have gone over routing algorithms, so developing a program that related was intriguing.
    There are routing problems in everyday life with trucking and delivery systems. Making a system that helped solve these issues within a simulator seemed like a good test. This project put my Java skills to the test.

  <p>
    When the simulator begins, lists of cargo, routes, and vehicles must be inputted by the user. The different vehicles that can be chosen have different advantages and disadvantages. Given the different constraints between vehicles, depending on the cargo and routes, a different result of which route to take could be chosen.

    We came up with the idea for this project based on our previous Elevator Simulator project. Using these principles, we ended up developing an overarching abstract vehicle class that encompassed the rest of the vehicles. We also had a Simulator class that held most of the logic for the program when it ran.
    We decided to code in Java since that's what we used in the rest of the class.

    Originally, we had chosen a different project that I had developed most of the logic for in a communication app. Then, we switched to this project and ended up developing most of the tests and reviewing the resulting classes from test-driven development. I was also involved in creating the UML diagram to help structure the program.
