            <!-- <p>I have decided to start my own small business in hopes to put a scholarship together for a trade school student, and do blue collar giveaways to future trade students. I was fortunate enough to receive the Mike Rowe Works scholarship while I was in lineman school along with many other scholarships and because of how much it helped me, I want to give that opportunity to someone else!</p> -->

                    <h4>Hello!</h4>
                    <p>My name is Mary, I am an avid archery hunter in Nevada! I started hunting with my dad when I was really young and have loved it ever since. My favorite Nevada animals to hunt are Bighorn Sheep and Elk!</p>
                    <p>I have a love for teaching and influencing those around me about blue collar work, especially young women who doubt their ability within the trades. I started unintentionally influencing women on TikTok in 2020 while I was in Power Lineman School. I had a TikTok go viral and since then I have enjoyed my chance to educate others about the trades.</p>
